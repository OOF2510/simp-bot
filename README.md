# The original simp bot

I reworte [Simp bot 10000](https://discordbotlist.com/bots/simp-bot-10000) because it wouldn't let me add it to my server, I tried hosting it myself, but it
kept crashing, so I rewrote the code and added a bunch of stuff of my own onto it. Simp bot 10000 seems to be abandoned now and is never online.

# The original simp bot
I reworte [Simp bot 1000](https://discordbotlist.com/bots/simp-bot-10000) because it was in too many servers and not verified, I tried hosting it myself, but it
kept crashing, so I rewrote the code and added a bunch of stuff of my own onto it. Simp bot 1000 seems to be abonded now and is never online.
